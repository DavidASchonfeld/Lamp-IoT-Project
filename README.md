# Lamp Internet of Things App and Arduino Project

This project was created by Adam Epstein and I, along with samples of code provided by the instructor.
There are two components:
-The Arduino board, which controls the light
-The phone app that is used to send commands to the board
These components communicate via Bluetooth.
