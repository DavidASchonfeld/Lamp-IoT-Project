# Lamp Internet of Things App and Arduino Project

This project was created by Adam Epstein and me, along with samples of code provided by the instructor. There are two components: the Arduino board, which controls the light and the phone app that is used to send commands to the board. The phone app was created using Apache Cordova. The app and the Arduino board communicate via Bluetooth.
